  \begin{column}{.48\columnwidth}
    We investigate the homogenized parameters of ferroelectric-dielectric composites under a static electric field. A numerical model that takes into account the coupling
    between the electrostatic problem and the electric field dependent permittivity of the
    ferroelectric material is used.
  \end{column}

  \begin{column}{.48\columnwidth}
    Metamaterials consisting of periodic and random arrays of rods
      are considered for the transverse electric polarization case
      and we study their effective permittivity, losses, electrically induced anisotropy
      and tunability by a two scale convergence homogenization method.

  \begin{posterblock}{Context}{benchcolor1}
    Ferroelectric materials play a crucial role in reconfigurable
    microwave devices, with typical applications including antenna beam steering,
    phase shifters, tunable power splitters, filters, voltage controlled oscillators and
    matching networks \cite{tagantsev_ferroelectric_2018}, and the key requirements are large tunability and low losses.
     These materials have high permittivity values even at microwave frequencies, which can be an issue in some practical
     applications. Thus it has been considered to mix ferroelectrics with low-index and
     low-loss non-tunable dielectrics in order to reduce both permittivity values and losses, or to
     use porous ceramics \cite{sherman_ferroelectric-dielectric_2006,padurariu_tailoring_2012}.

\mysubtitle{Ferroelectric permittivity}
Landau potential
given by $F(P,E) = F_0 +  a P^2/2 + b P^4/4 + cP^6/6 - EP$, where $E$ is
the applied electric field and $P$ is the polarization \cite{landau_electrodynamics_2013, zhou_dielectric_2008}
\begin{equation}
 \epsf(E) = \left[\frac{\partial^2 F (P, E)}{\partial P^2} \right]^{-1} = \frac{\epsf(0)}{1 + \alpha P_0^2 + \beta P_0^4},
 \label{eq_epsf}

 \epsftens (\B E) =

\mysubtitle{Coupled problem}

The electric field $\B E=-\grad V$ derived from the
solution of \equ{eq_elstat} depends on the permittivity distribution, which
itself depends on the electric field through \equ{eq_epsf}.

  \mysubtitle{Homogenization}
  Two scale convergence homogenization \cite{allaire_homogenization_1992, guenneau_homogenization_2000}, TE case:
  solutions $\psi_j$ of two annex problems $\mathcal P_j$, $j=\{1, 2\}$:
  \begin{equation}
   \div \left[ \xitens \grad(\psi_j + r_j) \right] = 0,
   \label{eq_hom_annex}
  \end{equation}
  where $\B r = (x, y)^{\rm T}$ and $\xitens=\epstens^{\rm T}/ {\rm det }(\epstens)$.\\
  The homogenized tensor $\xihom$ is obtained with:
  \begin{equation}
   \xihom = \langle \xitens \rangle + \B \phi,
   \label{eq_hom}
  \end{equation}
  where $\langle . \rangle$ denotes the mean value over the unit cell.
  Correction terms $\B \phi_{ij} = \langle \xitens \grad \psi_i \rangle_j$.\\

Equations~(\ref{eq_elstat}) and (\ref{eq_hom_annex}) are solved with a Finite Element
Method using the libre software Gmsh \cite{geuzaine_gmsh_2009} and GetDP \cite{dular_general_1998} driven by a Python package.
