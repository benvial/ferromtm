  We investigate the homogenized parameters of ferroelectric-dielectric composites under a static electric field. A numerical model that takes into account the coupling
  between the electrostatic problem and the electric field dependent permittivity of the
  ferroelectric material is used. Metamaterials consisting of periodic and random arrays of rods
  are considered for transverse electric polarization case
  and we study their effective permittivity, losses, electrically induced anisotropy
  and tunability by a two scale convergence homogenization method.}

  Ferroelectric materials play a crucial role in reconfigurable
  microwave devices, with typical applications including antenna beam steering,
  phase shifters, tunable power splitters, filters, voltage controlled oscillators and
  matching networks \cite{tagantsev_ferroelectric_2018}.

% \begin{posterblock}{Conclusion and outlook}{benchcolor1}
% We developped a model for the coupling of quasi-normal modes in meta-molecules, allowing 
% for a fast computation of coupled complex eigenfrequencies and QNMs. The validity of 
% our approach has been illustrated with an example of a dielectric nanorod dimmer. It 
% is found that shifting one of the resonator perpendicular to the dimmer axis induce a 
% symmetry breaking of the coupling mechanism.\\
% Future research directions includes:
% \begin{itemize}
%    \item model for TM polarization
%    \item include magnetic material	
%    \item include dispersion \cite{QNM3}
%    \item more than two coupled resonators
%     \item 3D model
%   \end{itemize}
