thicknes of sample 0.6mm

electrode wide 4.4mm
gap 3.8 

for software thickness is 3.8 
area 4.4x0.6 equivelent diameter 1.83


# I am think this is the oil we use

# , no dielectric properties on their site but it should be the same as 
# the attached medium viscosity silicone oil data sheet 
# (relative permitivity about 2.4 and very low loss
#
# it was a 2x3 array and the diameter of the holes was about 1.1mm  
# with some variation in diameter due to the way it was drilled, 
# the separation was a bit more varied from 0.2 to 0.4mm (between holes) 
# i have attached a scan (so scale is correct) if you need the exact 
# the exact dimensions/layout its a bit blury as the scanner is not too good here.
