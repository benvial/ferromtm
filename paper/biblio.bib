At a frequency of 10 kHz and a temperature of 18°C, as porosity increased from 0\% to 28.8\%, the dielectric constant of the BST ceramics (under zero bias field) decreased from ɛr(0)∼1690 to ɛr(0)∼990, while the dielectric losses were still less than 0.2\%, and the tunability increased from 17.6\% to 19.6\% (2.6 kV/mm).},

	abstract = {Porous ceramics with type 3–3 connectivity were prepared and investigated with a view to their application for ultrasound transducers. Ceramics with a porosity in the order of 0.4 to 0.5 exhibit sufficiently high permittivity (≈ 500), a thickness coupling factor equalling that of dense material (≈ 0.5), a low transverse coupling factor, a low vibrational Q (≈ 20) and low acoustic impedance (≈ 9·106kg/m2·s), all of which indicates their eminent suitability as a material for the fabrication of transducers as used in medical diagnostics. The experimentally determined influence of the porosity on the dielectric constants of these materials was used for the critical testing of various theories for calculating the constants of multiphase materials. It was found that the dielectric and elastic constants of porous piezoelectric ceramics can be very satisfactorily described on the basis of Bruggeman's theory, which has fallen somewhat into obscurity. Their piezoelectric properties are discussed with reference to an effective medium approximation and a cell model.},

The electrical and optical constants and polarization-reversal properties of these ceramics were determined as functions of grain size and porosity. When poled PLZT ceramics were aged, the polarization-reversal characteristic was quite asymmetric, apparently because a space-charge field, E8p, was generated during aging. From a detailed study of the behavior of the E8p, including its (1) generation with increasing aging time, (2) relaxation with repeated polarization reversals, (3) relaxation by heat depolarization, and (4) grain-size and porosity dependence, it is concluded that the space-charge layer is present inside every domain. This layer also explains the grain-size dependencies of the remanent polarization, piezoelectric constants, and Curie point.},

	abstract = {The role of porosity on the low and high field dielectric properties was studied in Ba0.70Sr0.30TiO3 ceramics with various porosity levels obtained by using lamellar graphite as sacrificial template. The permittivity decreases with increasing porosity, from around ε∼7690 (dense ceramic) down to 380 (ceramic with 29\% porosity), while preserving the Curie temperature at about 35°C. The effective permittivity was discussed by using Effective Medium Approximation and Finite Element Method approaches. The role of porosity and specific microstructural characteristics induced by the pore forming addition, from closed porosity (0–3) towards a combined (0–3, 2–2) with lamellar-type of microstructures for the most porous ceramics was taken into consideration. All the investigated ceramics preserve a high level of tunability as in the dense material, irrespective of the porosity level, while the zero field permittivity was decreased to a few hundreds.},

	abstract = {Thick films have been investigated for application in frequency and phase agile microwave devices. Since Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) and BaZr0.3Ti0.7O3 (BZT) bulk ceramics exhibit high tunability (τ=ε0−εEmaxε0) near room temperature, both compositions have been chosen for preparation of screen printed thick films. Low frequency dielectric properties have been characterized using metal-insulator-metal capacitor structures in a temperature range of −120 °C to +160 °C. Measurements of the bias dependent permittivity show a hysteresis effect in both materials in the whole investigated temperature range. BZT thick films exhibit a more diffuse phase transition than BST and therefore a lower temperature dependence. Permittivity, dielectric loss and tunability have also been determined at microwave frequencies from 4 to 90 GHz. Temperature and frequency dependence of the dielectric losses and tunability of both materials have been compared.},

The local field distributions in composite structures were determined and the field-induced permittivity was estimated for different volume fraction of conductive particles. The predicted tunability behavior agrees well with the observed trends obtained for gold nanoparticles embedded in chitosan matrix. The paper demonstrates the concept of engineered local fields in nanocomposites by using metallic nanoparticles as fillers in polymer matrix for tailoring the permittivity and tunability values.},

	abstract = {The grain size (GS) effect on the electric field dependence of the dielectric constant in ferroelectric nanoceramics was studied using a detailed model and the predicted behavior compared to experimental data obtained for BaTiO3. In the finest ceramics the permittivity reduces below 1000 and a tendency to linearization of the permittivity vs field dependence is observed. The composite structure of ferroelectric ceramics corresponding to ferroelectric grain cores separated by nonferroelectric grain boundaries determines a progressive increase of the electrical inhomogeneity of the system with decreasing GS. The local electric field was computed at various applied voltages for different GSs by a finite element approach, and then the effective permittivity-field response ɛeff(E) was determined by taking into consideration the local field distribution. A remarkable agreement between the model and experimental data was obtained for BaTiO3 ceramics. The local field distribution explains with considerable accuracy the reduction of permittivity and tunability observed with decreasing GS as well as the tendency towards linearization of ɛeff(E) in nanoceramics.},
