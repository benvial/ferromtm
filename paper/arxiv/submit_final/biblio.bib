At a frequency of 10 kHz and a temperature of 18°C, as porosity increased from 0\% to 28.8\%, the dielectric constant of the BST ceramics (under zero bias field) decreased from ɛr(0)∼1690 to ɛr(0)∼990, while the dielectric losses were still less than 0.2\%, and the tunability increased from 17.6\% to 19.6\% (2.6 kV/mm).},

	abstract = {Porous ceramics with type 3–3 connectivity were prepared and investigated with a view to their application for ultrasound transducers. Ceramics with a porosity in the order of 0.4 to 0.5 exhibit sufficiently high permittivity (≈ 500), a thickness coupling factor equalling that of dense material (≈ 0.5), a low transverse coupling factor, a low vibrational Q (≈ 20) and low acoustic impedance (≈ 9·106kg/m2·s), all of which indicates their eminent suitability as a material for the fabrication of transducers as used in medical diagnostics. The experimentally determined influence of the porosity on the dielectric constants of these materials was used for the critical testing of various theories for calculating the constants of multiphase materials. It was found that the dielectric and elastic constants of porous piezoelectric ceramics can be very satisfactorily described on the basis of Bruggeman's theory, which has fallen somewhat into obscurity. Their piezoelectric properties are discussed with reference to an effective medium approximation and a cell model.},

The electrical and optical constants and polarization-reversal properties of these ceramics were determined as functions of grain size and porosity. When poled PLZT ceramics were aged, the polarization-reversal characteristic was quite asymmetric, apparently because a space-charge field, E8p, was generated during aging. From a detailed study of the behavior of the E8p, including its (1) generation with increasing aging time, (2) relaxation with repeated polarization reversals, (3) relaxation by heat depolarization, and (4) grain-size and porosity dependence, it is concluded that the space-charge layer is present inside every domain. This layer also explains the grain-size dependencies of the remanent polarization, piezoelectric constants, and Curie point.},

	abstract = {The role of porosity on the low and high field dielectric properties was studied in Ba0.70Sr0.30TiO3 ceramics with various porosity levels obtained by using lamellar graphite as sacrificial template. The permittivity decreases with increasing porosity, from around ε∼7690 (dense ceramic) down to 380 (ceramic with 29\% porosity), while preserving the Curie temperature at about 35°C. The effective permittivity was discussed by using Effective Medium Approximation and Finite Element Method approaches. The role of porosity and specific microstructural characteristics induced by the pore forming addition, from closed porosity (0–3) towards a combined (0–3, 2–2) with lamellar-type of microstructures for the most porous ceramics was taken into consideration. All the investigated ceramics preserve a high level of tunability as in the dense material, irrespective of the porosity level, while the zero field permittivity was decreased to a few hundreds.},

Low frequency dielectric properties have been characterized using metal-insulator-metal capacitor structures in a temperature range of −120 °C to +160 °C. Measurements of the bias dependent permittivity show a hysteresis effect in both materials in the whole investigated temperature range. BZT thick films exhibit a more diffuse phase transition than BST and therefore a lower temperature dependence. Permittivity, dielectric loss and tunability have also been determined at microwave frequencies from 4 to 90 GHz.

In the finest ceramics the permittivity reduces below 1000 and a tendency to linearization of the permittivity vs field dependence is observed. The composite structure of ferroelectric ceramics corresponding to ferroelectric grain cores separated by nonferroelectric grain boundaries determines a progressive increase of the electrical inhomogeneity of the system with decreasing GS. The local electric field was computed at various applied voltages for different GSs by a finite element approach, and then the effective permittivity-field response ɛeff(E) was determined by taking into consideration the local field distribution. A remarkable agreement between the model and experimental data was obtained for BaTiO3 ceramics. The local field distribution explains with considerable accuracy the reduction of permittivity and tunability observed with decreasing GS as well as the tendency towards linearization of ɛeff(E) in nanoceramics.},

The CSRR is etched in the ground plane of the planar microstrip line. Two CSRRs of rectangular and circular cross-sections are chosen for the sensitivity analysis, where the later is found to possess higher sensitivity and hence appears to be more appropriate for the sensor design. At resonance, the electric field induced along the plane of CSRR is found to be quite sensitive for the characterization of specimen kept in contact with the sensor. A numerical model is developed here for the calculation of the complex permittivity as a function of resonant frequency and the quality factor data using the electromagnetic simulator, the Computer Simulation Technology. For practical applications, a detailed air gap analysis is carried out to consider the effect of any air gap present between the test sample and the CSRR. The designed sensor is fabricated and tested, and accordingly the numerically established relations are experimentally verified for various reference samples e.g., teflon, polyvinyl chloride, plexiglas, polyethylene, rubber, and wood. Experimentally, it is found that the permittivity measurement using the proposed sensor is possible with a typical error of 3\%.},

For SRRs on doped GaAs films, incident terahertz radiation with peak fields of ∼20–160 kV/cm drives intervalley scattering. This reduces the carrier mobility and enhances the SRR LC response due to a conductivity decrease in the doped thin film. Above ∼160 kV/cm, electric field enhancement within the SRR gaps leads to efficient impact ionization, increasing the carrier density and the conductivity which, in turn, suppresses the SRR resonance. We demonstrate an increase of up to 10 orders of magnitude in the carrier density in the SRR gaps on semi-insulating GaAs. Furthermore, we show that the effective permittivity can be swept from negative to positive values with an increasing terahertz field strength in the impact ionization regime, enabling new possibilities for nonlinear metamaterials.},

First, FMNW metamaterials are placed in the historical context of antique composites and 20th Century artificial dielectrics, and presented as an example of second-generation metamaterials following the microstructured metamaterials developed in the first part of the decade. Next, the fabrication processes of FMNW metamaterials and subsequent planar devices are detailed. It is then shown how the geometrical properties of the FMNW structure, such as the wire diameter and the wire nanodisk thicknesses, determine the dc and RF responses of the material. Upon this basis, the modeling of the metamaterial is presented, using a two-level approach where the microscopic (with respect to the wires) susceptibility is derived by solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation and the macroscopic (metamaterial) permittivity and permeability tensors are obtained by effective medium theory. Next, a review of FMNW microwave devices, such as circulators, isolators, and phase shifters, is provided, and the example of an FMNW dual-band edge-mode isolator is studied. Finally, spintronic effects and applications of FMNW metamaterials, such as dc to RF generators and detectors based on the spin-torque transfer phenomenon, are reviewed.},

	abstract = {Near-infrared metamaterials that possess a reconfigurable index of refraction from negative through zero to positive values are presented. Reconfigurability is achieved by cladding thin layers of liquid crystal both as a superstrate and a substrate on an established negative-index metamaterial, and adjusting the permittivity of the liquid crystal. Numerical results show that the index of refraction for the proposed structure can be changed over the range from -1 to +1.8 by tuning the liquid crystal permittivity from 2 to 6 at a wavelength of 1.4 μm.},

	abstract = {Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics (Bi1−xNa0.8K0.2Lax)0.5TiO3 were synthesized successfully by conventional solid state reaction method. The piezoelectric, dielectric and ferroelectric characteristics of the ceramics were investigated and discussed. The XRD results show that La3+ has diffused into (BiNa0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 (BNKT) lattices to form a new solid solution (Bi1−xNa0.8K0.2Lax)0.5TiO3 with a pure perovskite structure. Partial substitution of La3+ for Bi3+ in the BNKT ceramics can enhance their piezoelectric, without an obvious decline of ferroelectric properties. The piezoelectric measurements and P–E hysteresis loops reveal that the ceramic with x=0.005 has the highest piezoelectric performance and strong ferroelectricity. At high La3+ level (x{\textgreater}0.04), the low dielectric anomaly at Td disappears. A maximum strain of 0.16\% is obtained at x=0.02 for the (Bi1−xNa0.8K0.2Lax)0.5TiO3 ceramic. The depolarization temperature Td decreases with x increasing (x=0–0.08), and the depolarization mechanism is analyzed.},
